An island moved northward for a million years and hit a larger landmass. Mountains rose and rivers flow. People came, thrived; new people came, thrived; new ideas formed, old ideas extinguished; wars happened, ideologies created, religions established. This is the story of India. Who came first? Who came second? Who came later? To whom does the land belong? This is also the story of India. The former set of statements feed the latter questions, and vice versa. 

The tribe of Nagas were the inhabitants in the land of what we call Tamil Nadu today, 2500 years ago. So has been the premise set in the movie of Thangalaan. New people came and introduced the Varna caste system that created divisions based on birth. Some of the groups in these original inhabitants welcomed the new people but eventually they were oppressed by the new landlords and the Brahmin priests, and became untouchables. These oppressed people welcomed the Sakhya Muni, the Buddha and his principles. And over time, Buddhism waned while Hinduism waxed. The movie has this mytho-history thread as its core vision. 

The story is set in early 19th century and is about a village of these oppressed people in Veppur, North Arcot area. Bonded in slave labor by the landlords, they welcome the quest of a British named Lord Clement to find gold in the area of Kolar under the leadership of a man named Thangalaan. There have been stories about old kings mining gold from there, Cholas, two thousand years ago, and Tipu Sultan, a hundred years back. A brahmin works as a translator and a helper to Clement. And this has been shown the case right rom earlier days. A brahmin worked as an advisor to the Chola king as well who sought the same gold. Thus, the movie talks about similar events repeating in history. The Brahmins at the forefront uses the caste system as a tool to help their masters, first the kings, and now, observing the change in power, the British. The landlord who are descendants of erstwhile kings are now served by the next in line in the caste hierarchy, the Pillais. Interpolating outside the movie, one could observe, within the next hundred years, this alliance of non-Brahmin landlords and upper castes, and slowly other non-Brahmins, established the Dravidian movement.

The movie is layered into three. One is the present time of Thangalaan and his village of oppressed people helping Clement to find gold. Another is the historic past when the Nagas acted as protectors of the land and the gold mountain. And the third one is in the myth believed by Thangalaan's people about the guardian-sorceress, Aarathi, who does not let anyone enter the gold land, and by extension how this myth plays as a vision inside Thangalaan's head. We are only presented with the first and the third -- the reality to find gold and the myth of a person who protects it. The crux of the movie lies in conjoining the two with the second layer of the historic past. That the myth is a form in which history is remembered by the people. Myth is a powerful form of influence. Religions exploit it heavily and so do ideologies and politics. People who were stripped of everything, from being literate, from owing land, from leading a dignified life -- they have only one tool to remember history, that is, myth.
